# Ultra-Nightmare Save Manager

A simple save manager for DOOM that can be used to exploit the game's save I/O and checkpoint
system during an Ultra-Nightmare session.

## Usage

The tool is very easy to use, simply run the game on Ultra-Nightmare, when you hit a checkpoint,
alt-tab out of the game and use `b` to create a backup of the current save data. Then enter `r`
in the tool upon death, or after returning to the game after exiting it previously.

## Features

The tool can now automatically boot the game using the Steam app Id.
